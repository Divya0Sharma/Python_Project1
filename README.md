I’m excited to share my recent data analysis and visualization project on Tele-Law Services in India — a dataset-driven deep dive into how legal aid is accessed across states, districts, social categories, and genders.
🔍 Key Objectives of the Project:
✅ 1️⃣ Analyzing State-wise and District-wise Trends in Tele-Law case registrations.
 ✅ 2️⃣ Exploring Gender-based Legal Advice Patterns to highlight disparities.
 ✅ 3️⃣ Studying Social Category Representation (General, OBC, SC, ST) for legal service usage.
 ✅ 4️⃣ Evaluating CSC (Common Service Centers) Performance in delivering legal advice.
 ✅ 5️⃣ Using Predictive Analysis to model future Tele-Law case trends.
 ✅ 6️⃣ Visualizing the Relationship between CSC Count and Total Cases using Scatter Plots.
 ✅ 7️⃣ Presenting State-wise Distribution of Total Cases via Pie Charts.
💡 The project combined:
 📊 Pandas & Seaborn for data cleaning and analysis,
 📈 Matplotlib & Seaborn for insightful visualizations
🎯 Takeaway:
 This project gave me hands-on experience with real-world datasets, trend spotting, and visual storytelling — key skills for any aspiring data analyst or data scientist.
